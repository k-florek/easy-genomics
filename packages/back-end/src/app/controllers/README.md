This folder contains Easy Genomics' Back-End controller sub-folder defining the Lambda Functions for REST API endpoints.

Each Lambda function defined needs to follow the snake-case naming convention, and needs to
start with one of the following verbs that will auto-link to the REST API request method:
	- create | abort | complete | request = HTTP POST request
	- list | read = HTTP GET request
	- update | cancel = HTTP PUT request
	- patch = HTTP PATCH request
	- delete = HTTP DELETE request
	- process = None // Generic operation not mapped to REST API (e.g. S3 Event Trigger, etc.)
